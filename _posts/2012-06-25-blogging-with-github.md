================

Prompted by a friend talking about [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), I
decided to learn how easily I could put together a blog system based on
markdown and github.  I'm clearly not the first.  Here's a handful of useful
links I learned from:

* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) - written by a founder of github
* [Jekyll boilerplate](https://github.com/necolas/jekyll-boilerplate)
* [Jekyll base](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base)
* [Turnkey Solution](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) - I didn't use this, but read about it
* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/)
